Like assignment 1, assignment 2 consists of two parts. 
1- The First task is 'Sentiment classificaton'. Open the directory called "Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_Task1" and launch the notebook called "Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb". That notebook will walk you through sentiment classification. 

2- Once done with part 1, open the directory called 'The_Federalist_Papers_Task2', and 
   a) run the following command to install
   necessary packages specified in requirements.txt file:

   >>> pip install -r requirements.txt

   b) Launch the notebook called 'Who_Wrote_that.ipynb'
   That notebook will walk you through language modeling.


Better yet, you can create a separate environment in step 0 as you did in assignment 1.
