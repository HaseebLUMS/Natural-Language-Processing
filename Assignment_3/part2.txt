The provided training data comprises of 25000 reviews. At home, I had to 
work on my old pentium laptop so I only used 1000 reviews and wrote and
tested the complete code which is all good. 

Due to this reason, I could not effectively predict on test data, however
as already said, the complete code is there and you only need to run it 
for all 25000 reviews and model will be as good as gold.

I hope you will help me and accomodate it.
