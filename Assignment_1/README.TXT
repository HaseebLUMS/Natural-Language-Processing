You need to install certain packages first- specified in 'requirements.txt' file.

1. See the attached 'Set up Guide' to install anaconda if you don't have it already.

2. Create a new environment called 'NLP' using GUI of anconda or using the command below (without quotes):

"conda create -n nlp"

3. After creating the environment, go to that environment in anaconda and install Jupyter Notebook. 

You'll find this link (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) useful. You may also find this post on environments useful (https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-python-environments-using-conda-32e9f2779307).

4. To activate the environment you just created, enter the command below (without quotes) for Windows:


"activate nlp" 

4. To activate the environment you just created, enter the command below (without quotes) for Mac/Linux:

"source activate nlp"

5. Make sure your current directory contains the file 'requirements.text'. In other words, your current directory is 'Assignment_1'

		  5a) To install git run the following command (without quotes):
		  "conda install git"

		  5b) run the following command to install
   		necessary packages specified in requirements.txt file (without quotes):

  		 "pip install -r requirements.txt"

  		 It may take a while.

  		5c) Using anaconda, launch the notebook. Then, navigate to the notebook called 'Assignment1_notebook1_[student_ID].ipynb' in directory 'Part_1' of 'Assignment_1'
  		The notebook will guide you further.

  		5d) On successfully finishing the part 1, move on to the part 2 and launch 
  		 'Political_Inclination_from_Tweets.ipynb'. In the directory 'Part_2', you have some supplementary notes (two notebooks) that you may find useful.
  		 You may rename this notebook as well with your ID.
